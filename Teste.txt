Eva is a cook and went shopping for Sunday lunch. She prefers to buy vegetables at the supermarket next to her house. The meat she always buys at the butcher shop and the fish at the fishmonger.

In addition, Eve often eats many fruits, such as bananas, apples, avocados, pineapples, grapes and watermelons. She usually buys fruit from the grocery store in her neighborhood.

In her home, Eva has a garden where she plants some types of vegetables, such as onion, mint and basil that are used as spices.

On Sundays, Eve prepares cakes and pies. She uses flour, eggs, milk and other ingredients that are also bought at the supermarket.

When it is cold, she prefers to prepare vegetable and meat soups. Lentil broth with pieces of meat is one of your favorite meals in winter. On warmer days, Eva makes ice cream and other refreshing foods such as frozen fruit juices.

The cook likes to know new species of food and for this she watches programs that talk about the subject and reads several books on this subject.
